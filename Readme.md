### WSL Setup (Windows)

Enable WSL and Virtual Machine Platform

# Requires Powershell Admin Privileges
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

# Enable WSL 2
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

Install [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n6svws3rx71) or any other choice of Linux Distribution from [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/wslstore).

> The first time you launch a newly installed Linux distribution, a console window will open and you'll be asked to wait for a minute or two for files to de-compress and be stored on your PC. All future launches should take less than a second.
